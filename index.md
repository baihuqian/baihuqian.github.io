Since May 2015, I work as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon Web Services in Northern Virginia outside Washington DC. My team owns the [Virtual Private Network (VPN)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpn-connections.html) service, which provides encrypted connectivity to your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and the newly-launched [AWS Transit Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/) service, which provides centralized connectivity and management across thousands of networks. They are the core offerings in AWS's Infrastructure-as-a-Service ecosystem and main building blocks for enterprise-level, global, hybrid cloud networks.

Before joining AWS, I received Master's degree from [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.ece.cmu.edu/), and Bachelor's degree in Information and Communication Engineering at [Zhejiang University, China](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

I currently hold the following certifications:

I love food, photography, cars, and biking.
