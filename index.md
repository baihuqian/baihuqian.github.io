I am a Senior Software Development Engineer at Amazon Web Services in Chicago, IL. My team owns
* [Virtual Private Network (VPN)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpn-connections.html) service, which provides encrypted connectivity to your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC);
* [AWS Transit Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/) service, which provides centralized connectivity and management across thousands of networks;
* [AWS Transit Gateway Network Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/network-manager/), which provides a single global view of your private network.

Prior to joining AWS, I received Master's degree from [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.ece.cmu.edu/), and Bachelor's degree in Information and Communication Engineering at [Zhejiang University, China](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

This is my personal blog. I write about pretty much everything that I care about. I hope you finding it interesting and helpful. Recently I have been writing about setup, security, privacy about home network that help improve the digital life of my family.
