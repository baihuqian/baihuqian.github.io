Since May 2015, I have been working as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon Web Services. My team owns the [Virtual Private Network (VPN)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpn-connections.html) service, which provides encrypted connectivity to your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). It is a core service offering in AWS's Infrastructure-as-a-Service ecosystem and a main enabler of hybrid cloud or multi-cloud architecture. Launched 10 years ago, it is still one of the fastest growing service in AWS with more than 60% of Year-over-Year growth (AWS as a whole grows at 40% YoY).

My main responsibility are:
1. Design and develop public features;
1. Architect services to address scaling challenges;
1. Improve service operations.

In 2017, I directly lead, or participated in, the following public features:
* [VPC Expansion](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/08/amazon-virtual-private-cloud-vpc-now-allows-customers-to-expand-their-existing-vpcs/)
* [Custom PSK and Inside Tunnel IP for AWS VPN](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/10/aws-vpn-update-custom-psk-inside-tunnel-ip-and-sdk-update/)
* [Configurable Amazon side private Autonomous System Number for Virtual Private Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/10/now-you-can-configure-amazon-side-private-autonomous-system-number-for-your-virtual-private-gateway/)

Before joining AWS, I received Master's degree from [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.ece.cmu.edu/), and Bachelor's degree in Information and Communication Engineering at [Zhejiang University, China](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

I currently hold the following certifications:
