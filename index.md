I am a Senior Software Development Engineer at Amazon Web Services in Chicago, IL. My team owns
* [AWS Transit Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/) service, which provides centralized connectivity and management across thousands of networks;
* [AWS Cloud WAN](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-wan/), which is a managed wide area networking (WAN) service that makes it easy for you to build, manage, and monitor a global network that connects resources running across your cloud and on-premises environments.

Prior to joining AWS, I received Master's degree from [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.ece.cmu.edu/), and Bachelor's degree in Information and Communication Engineering at [Zhejiang University, China](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

This is my personal blog. I write about pretty much everything that I care about. I hope you finding it interesting and helpful. Recently I have been writing about setup, security, privacy about home network that help improve the digital life of my family.
