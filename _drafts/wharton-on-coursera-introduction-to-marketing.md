This course covers three core topics in customer loyalty:

* Branding: brand equity is one of the key elements of keeping customers in a dynamic world in which new startups are emerging constantly.
* Customer centricity: not synonymous with customer service, customer centricity starts with customer focus and need-gathering.
* Go-to-market strategies: understand the drivers that influence customers and see how these are implemented prior to making an investment.

# Marketing 101
The essence of marketing is to have a very strong brand.

A market is an **exchange** between two partners, frequently a buyer and a seller, but it also applies to non-profit transactions. What marketing means is going to differ as a function of different aspects of those exchange. The two extremes of exchanges are **buyer**'s market and **seller's** market.

The seller's market means the seller has a product, and if you want that product, you have to come to the seller. So the seller has all the power. It is *product-focused market* and the objective is to sell as much as you can, and profitability comes from *market share* (higher revenue, lower average cost). The growth comes from new products based on your product experience and new markets.

The buyer's market has lots of competition, a lot of products out there, and the buyer has the power. Marketing focuses on customer and competition and creates the best product that meets customer needs so that they buy from you instead of the competitors. It is too difficult to develop products for every single customer, so your customer segment is important in *customer-focused marketing*. The profitability comes from increased **price premium**, delivering value over time ("**loyalty**") at often lower cost (it's more expensive to acquire customers than delivering goods over time through loyalty) and selling other things to the same customer through "**cross-selling**". In short, profitability comes from "*customer share*" (get more from each customer).

Due to social media, internet, and globalization, customers talk to customers about their *experience* about the transactions. Marketing in such a "connected community" world focuses on customer experience.

Due to economic recession and scandals, marketing also needs to focus on gaining customer *trust*.

Differentiator        | Persuade customer to want what the firm offers | Persuade firm to offer what the customer wants | Manage customer's entire experience with the firm | Prioritize building a relationship of trust and discipline
Product focus         | Generic Products                               | Differentiated Product/Services                | Experiential Value                                | Genuine Value
Competitive Advantage | Lowest Cost                                    | Quality and Service, Customer Knowledge        | Transformation; customer as co-creator of value   | Trust
Profitability Drivers | Market Share                                   | Customer Share and Customer Loyalty            | Buzz, Word-of-Mouth, Referrals                    | Discipline

The **3 principles of marketing**:
* **Principle of Customer Value**: if you want to provide something to a customer, to a buyer, and get them to buy from you rather than the competition, you've got to give them real, genuine customer value.
* **Principle of Differentiation**: You have to provide customer value to that customer, what the customer wants, but you have to do it better than the competition (i.e., differentiate the offering).
* **Principle of Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning**: when you're in a customer focused market, you cannot deliver value to everybody and make money, it's just too difficult to do. So what you do is segment the market into different segments. You target or choose a segment you want to focus on, and you position your brand to meet the needs of that target segment.

The **4 P's of Marketing** are the tools to deliver these three marketing principles:
* Product (what the seller puts into the exchange)
* Place (the way the seller delivers the product to the customer)
* Promotion (the way the seller communicates the benefits about that product to the buyer)
* Price (what the buyer puts into the exchange)

# Branding: Marketing Strategy and Brand Positioning

## Strategic Marketing
It is a framework to figure out how to think competitively and become a leader in the market. The framework is based on a set of strong principles, or assumptions:
* **Know your markets**. You know what your customers want. And furthermore, you know how your competitors are likely to react.
* **Customers have the final say**. When comparing products, because there are so many factors, customers bundle factors into three categories: *operational* (e.g., price and delivery), *product features and designs*, and *customized to my need*. Customers assign scores to each category, identify the most important category, and find the product that performs the best in this category while being good enough in others.
* **Commit to being first in the market you serve**. Being the best in your chosen category while good enough in other categories should be your market strategy.

A *value map* is the relation between *relative cost to the customer* and *relative perceived benefit*. The *fair-value line* is the fair cost for a given level of benefit.

![Value Map]({{ "/assets/posts/coursera-marketing/value-map.png" | absolute_url }})

The area above is inferior value and the area below is superior value. The fair value is not constant; it changes as the market competitiveness changes over time.

The framework is as follows:
![Value Map]({{ "/assets/posts/coursera-marketing/strategic-marketing.png" | absolute_url }})

The three bundles:
* Operational Excellence;
* Performance Superiority;
* Customer Intimacy.
The crosshatches are fair value lines. Note that the three bundles don't have to be symmetric.

The framework involves the following steps:
1. Map product attributes to each bundle.
2. Anticipate the fair value points. These should be the customer expectation, not the average of what everybody offers (because the industry could under- or over-perform as a whole). This is the trickiest in the framework.
3. Determine where the company is on each axis relative to the fair value.
4. Figure out where your competition is on each axis.
5. Put together the short-term strategy (what should you be doing right now in order to beat the competition?) and long-term strategy (to be the best at one dimension and good enough on the other two).
6. Implement the strategy in your firm.

## Segmentation and Targeting
Brand positioning is a critical idea in marketing. The positioning process is called the **STP framework**: Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning.
* Segmentation: identify variables that allow one to segment the market;
* Targeting: evaluate the attractiveness of each segment and choose a target segment;
* Positioning: identify positioning concepts for each target segment, select the best, and communicate it.

Market segmentation is the process of dividing a market into distinct subset, where any subset any conceivably be selected as a marketing target to be reached with a distinct marketing mix (4 P's). Segmentation methods include:
1. Characteristics of the customer (e.g., demographics): such as *cohort analysis* (baby boomers vs. millennials), *geographic segmentation* like regional segmentation, zip clustering (rich neighborhoods across the US);
2. Benefits sought;
3. Systematic, product-related behaviors (e.g., purchasing behavior like online vs. in store).

To select a target segment, we must balance segment attractiveness with our capability to deliver to the segment, and continuously monitor whether the actual buyers match the target segment. Criteria include:

* About segment:
  * segment size;
  * growth of segment;
  * value of segment;
  * stability;
* About the company:
  * current company position within the segment;
  * ease of entry into segment;
* About competitors:
  * ease of competitive entry into segment;
  * number and strength of competitors.

Develop measures of segment attractiveness and select among attractive segments based on business capabilities.

## Brand Positioning
Brand, formally, is a proprietary trademark for a specific product or service. Conceptually, brand is a "contract" from the company to its customers; a promise of specific benefits, quality, and value; a relationship. In today's connected community, brand is what customers think it is and tell each other it is.

A positioning statement defines the value proposition of product to the target market. It consists of:
* Target segment (for whom).
* Point of difference (differentiator to competitors and reason to buy).
* Frame of reference (other competitors, or called points of parity).

The point of difference is relative to the frame of reference. Positioning should

* focus on a few key benefits;
* be defensible from your competitors;
* require making choices in all three areas. You cannot have everything for every segment.

Point of Parity (POP) is associations that are not unique to the brand; they are shared with other brands (because it is a relative, comparative measurement). For example, **category POPs** are associations customer views as necessary to be considered credible, such as diary in a grocery store, and **competitive POPs** are associations designed to negate competitors' point of difference, such as fluoride in every toothpaste.

Point of Difference (POD) is similar to the notion of *unique selling proposition*. It should be strong, favorable, unique brand associations. It should be the sustainable competitive advantage (SCA) in order for the positioning to be defensible; that is, to achieve an advantage in the marketplace for a prolonged period of time. POD may involve: performance attributes, benefits, imagery associations. Good POD should be
* desirable to the customer: relevant and distinctive;
* possible to deliver to the customer: feasible, communicable, sustainable over time.

## Brand Mantra: the Elevator Speech
You can have a lot of ideas about positioning, but it is hard to hone in to the right choice and come up with a precise and crisp brand mantra.

A mental map, or semantic associative network, can develop a picture of the thought and associations that come up with the brand. It portrays branch associations and responses for a target market, and shows how it is actually perceived. A mental map of McDonald's can look like this:

![Value Map]({{ "/assets/posts/coursera-marketing/mental-map-mcdonalds.png" | absolute_url }})

After doing *mental maps* for multiple customers, find the set fo abstract concepts or phrases that Characterize the five to ten most important dimensions of the mental map of the brand (i.e., *core brand values*), relate them to points-of-parity and points-of-difference, and come up with the *brand mantra*.

Brand mantra is the articulation of the "heart and soul" of the brand, short three- to five-word phrases that capture the irrefutable essence or spirit of the brand positioning and brand values. It is known by customers and employees and is everywhere. It has three parts:

* The **brand function** describes the nature of the product or service or the type of experiences or benefits the brand provides.
* The **descriptive modifier** further clarifies its nature.
* The **emotional modifier** provides another qualifier - how exactly does the brand provide benefits, and in what way?

Brand mantra can describe what a brand does and also what a brand is *not*.

## Experiential Branding
In a connected community world, customer experience is vital. You have to define the experience around the brand besides the brand positioning.

Experiences are processes that occur as a result of encountering, undergoing or living through situation (it's continuous). They are triggered stimulations to the senses, heart, and mind. They connect the company and the brand to the customer's lifestyle and place individual customer actions and purchase occasions in a broader social context.

Experiential brand positioning is
1. what the brand stands for;
2. should be a multi-sensory strategy;
3. should be different in some real and valuable way from all competitors.

Experiential brand value promise describes what customers get in experiential terms: sense, feel, think, act, and relate.

Experiential components are:
* Five senses: consistent experiences across senses. It creates a sensory experience that extends across channels.
* Emotions: appeals to customers' inner feelings and emotions.
* Cognitive: appeal to the intellect, engage customers creatively, problem-solving experiences; use of surprise, intrigue and provocation.
* Behave: affect bodily experiences and lifestyles, enrich customer lives; show them alternative ways of doing things, alternative lifestyles. It can be rational but also motivational, inspirational and spontaneous.
* Social: create feeling of community or belonging; the "future ideal" self that consumer wants to relate themselves to.

Experiential value are delivered through 4 P's:
* Product: build in experiential features (e.g., Apple);
* Place: store/website design, music, fragrance, type of salespeople (e.g., Sephora);
* Promotion: noteworthy, experiential "brand personality";
* Price (e.g., eBay's auction, Priceline's bidding).

## Summary

Strong Brands                                                | Weak Brands
-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------

Other characteristics of great brands include:
* **Consistency** in delivering on their promise;
* **Superior** products and processes;
* **Distinctive** positioning and customer experience;
* **Alignment** of internal and external commitment to the brand.

# Customer Centricity
In strategic marketing, one bundle is customer intimacy. This section focuses on it, or called "customer centricity".

The goal of a firm is to **maximize shareholders' value**. Maximum profits through **volume and cost reduction**. One key performance indicator is market share, which not only is a indicator of the present, but also of the future. Such metrics, like market share and others, are central to this product superiority, or operationally excellent strategy. Shareholders demand growth. Growth can be achieved through **extending the product**, either through bringing existing ones to new market, or by creating new ones. Companies are **organized by product**. And thus, the competitive advantage of an organization or a company is **product expertise**. This is the traditional, *product-centric* way of business.

While product centricity is not doomed to fail, there are trends that don't exist 15 or 20 years ago that reduces the chance of success of it:
* **Commoditization**: technology-driven product development that shortens the product lifecycle.
* **Smart customers**: technology-driven information flows make customers aware of existing and new product options and put more demands on companies.
* **Retail saturation**: technology-driven delivery that makes more products available to more customers in more locations.
* **Globalization**.
* **Deregulation**.
* Customers want **end-to-end solutions**. Companies act like trusted advisors. One example is IBM, once a product-centric company, moves to provide solutions by selling its hardware businesses.
* Information systems enable **customer-level tracking** and thus data-driven business models.

## Direct Marketing
Direct marketing is an advertising strategy that relies on the individual distribution of a sales pitch to potential customers. In other words, the individual customer is the unit of analysis. It tries to **know who there customers** are and what they buy, aim to **determine marketing communication** based on past purchases, and constantly determine (and leverage) individual **customer value**.

Any company that's operating on the internet, any company that has the capability to track a particular customer over time are using direct marketing.

## Customer Centricity
**Customer centricity** is a strategy that aligns a company's development/delivery of its products/services around the current and future needs of *a select set of customers* in order to maximize their *long-term financial value* to the firm.

Customer centricity requires the company to be willing and able to change its organizational design, performance metrics, and employee/distributor incentive structures to focus on this long-run value creation/delivery process. For example, the performance metrics for salespeople should not be monthly/quarterly revenue, but long-term value increase of customers so that customers create more value in the company in the long run.

It is important to recognize that the overarching goal for customer-centric companies is still to maximize shareholders' value. But the customer-centric world embraces customer heterogeneity: not all customers are equal, some customers are more profitable than others. When we talk about *profitability*, we focus on future profitability (**customer lifetime value**) rather than past profits. We need to use models and technology in order to project the future value of our customers.

Success arises through enhanced (and/or more efficient) customer **acquisition, retention, and development**. The competitive advantage is the "relationship expertise" with respect to focal customers (that cannot be commoditized).

However, customer centricity does **not** suggest that "non-focal" customers should be ignored or "fired". To the contrary, it is important to have a healthy portion of such customers to add a high degree of stability and robustness to the overall customer base (like bonds in an investment portfolio). Taking this idea future, there is a **paradox of customer centricity**: the more that a firm tightens its central focus on a select group of customers, the more it needs its "non-focal" customers to stabilize the overall mix.

To move to customer centricity, below are important questions:
* Who is the customer? Can your organization come up with a single, consensus answer to this question, or can you at least reconcile the roles/relationships of the different potential customers?
* What are the major barriers to move to customer centricity, and what resources can you utilize to overcome these barriers.
* What competitors are doing in this area? Is it better for everyone be customer-centric or only you?
* Does it make sense for your organization to become customer centric? If so, what should be your immediate goals and medium-term expectations?
