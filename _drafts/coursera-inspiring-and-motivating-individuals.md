# Becoming a Visionary Leader

The leader of a team accounts for 31% of whether that team performs well or not. Most critical and essential behaviors that leaders are engaging in, that enable teams to perform well, are:
* Create and communicate the vision (that provides the team a sense of shared direction and meaning);
* Structure the team (roles, responsibilities, interdependence);
* Show consideration for individual team members.

Vision is where we are today and where we are going. The ability of leaders to create and communicate the vision accounts for 6% of team's success. This is most important in times of uncertainty. The vision we discuss here is not written up on the walls; it is what you communicate every day through your words and your action.

Both what you say (substance) and how you say it (style) are important.

Substance answers three fundamental questions:
1. About the purpose of why your team exists: **why do we do what we do**.
2. Definition of success: **what does success look like**.
3. The values that guide the choices and behaviors of the team: **how must we act to ensure success**.

Here is a checklist on what you say (style):
* Refer to fundamental values answered in "how we must act to ensure success".
* Use stories, anecdotes, metaphors, or analogies that will resonate with the team.
* Use rhetorical questions (questions that don't necessarily have an answer but that provoke thoughts) and 3-part lists (3 things in summary, then in detail, then in conclusion).
* Express moral conviction by referring to the beneficiaries of your work in "why do we do what we do".
* Use inclusive language like "we", "our", instead of "I" or "me".
* Repeat, repeat, repeat.

Up to 60% of the socio-emotional meaning of a message is conveyed via *non-verbal* cues! The effectiveness is not at all about being loud. The keys to success are:
* Vary your intonation, volume, and pitch;
* Smile (genuinely);
* Maintain an open body posture.
