If you own rental properties and use a property manager, you will receive 1099-MISC that reports the total rental income of the year. Usually you will receive a single 1099-MISC that covers all of your properties, and when you import it into TurboTax, the software asks you to attribute it to one of your properties. You would think: "it would be OK to attribute the income to one of the properties because the expenses from other properties would be losses that cancel the excessive income, right?"

Well, not quite. It has to do with Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction, especially when you do not treat all your properties as a single "enterprise".

When you treat your properties as separate "trades" or "businesses", the income and loss of each of them are calculated separately for QBI deduction purposes. Hence, the property with excessive income would produce too much QBI that could be used for deduction, which is incorrect. QBI does not require itemization to qualify, and you can take it even with standard deduction. Hence, taking too much QBI deduction can be problematic.

If you treat all your properties as a single enterprise, then it does not really matter because QBI is calculated by aggregating the income and expense of all your properties together. But it's better to be safe if you change your mind later.

TurboTax does not allow attributing income from 1099-MISC to multiple properties in its workflow, so we have to split the income and enter a separate 1099-MISC for every property. You can find the total income for each property from your whole-year income statement, and you can use the number to "produce" a separate 1099-MISC as if your property manager generates one for each of your property. You need to make sure the sum of all your manually-splitted 1099-MISC matches to the aggregate one.

This way, TurboTax will produce the right Income value on Schedule E as well as Form 8995-A, and calculate the right rental income and QBI deduction regardless whether you elect for the "safe harbor test" or "enterprise". TurboTax could provide a way to split the income from 1099-MISC in its user interface, but until it comes, we have to use this workaround to produce the right tax forms.
