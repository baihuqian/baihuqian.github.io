This is the course notes I took when studying [Introduction to Operations Management](https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-operations/), offered by Wharton on Coursera.

The four dimensions of operational performance are:
* Cost: the **efficiency** of the operations;
* **Quality**:
  * performance (product) quality (how good?)
  * comformance (process) quality (as good as promised?)
* **Variety**: customer heterogeneity;
* Time: **responsiveness** to demand.

These four dimensions are important for 1) performance measurement and 2) defining a business strategy. Strategy guru, Michael Porter, suggested there are two ways in which an organization can get a competitive advantage: either through cost leadership or through differentiation. The dimensions that we discussed -- variety, quality and timeliness -- are three ways in which your operation can differentiate itself from others.

Ideally, as a business, we want to excel at all four areas. However, it is not possible as some goals, such as labor efficiency and responsiveness, are conflicting. Thus, we need to make tradeoffs. If we draw the performance metrics of two dimensions on a graph for all industry players, and the highest level of the *efficiency frontier* of the current industry, and the difference between a firm with the efficiency frontier is the *inefficiency*. By redesigning the process, it is possible to improve beyond the current efficiency frontier, and the firm gains a competitive advantage over the industry.

# Process Analysis
First we discuss three most important performance measures of an operation, **flow rate** (also known as **throughput**), **inventory**, and **flow time**. They are defined as follows:

* Flow rate / throughput: number of flow units going through the process per unit of time;
* Flow Time: time it takes a flow unit to go from the beginning to the end of the process;
* Inventory: the number of flow units in the process at a given moment in time;
* Flow Unit: an atomic unit of analysis, e.g., customer for a restaurant.

If we draw the cumulative inflow and outflow of a process on the same graph, the flow time is the horizontal difference between the two lines, and inventory is the vertical difference between the two lines.
![Cumulative Flow]({{ "/assets/posts/coursera-operations-management/cumulative-flow.png" | absolute_url }})

Note that "inventory" would show up in an accounting balance sheet if the flow unit is goods under production. It will not show up if it is to measure services. Inventory takes up more than 1 trillion dollars on the balance sheet of US companies in the manufacturing sector. Inventory happens whenever you have mismatches between supply and demand.

## Bottleneck
The **processing time** or the **activity time** is the time taken for a flow unit to go through an activity ("how long does the worker spend on the task?"). It is expressed in unit of time per flow unit.

Process flow diagram visualizes the process with
* triangles standing for flow units waiting;
* arrows capturing the flow of the flow units;
* boxes capturing the resources that carry out the activities in the process flow.

![Process Flow Diagram]({{ "/assets/posts/coursera-operations-management/process-flow-diagram.png" | absolute_url }})

**Capacity** is $$1/\text{processing time}$$. It answers "how many units can the worker make per unit of time?" If there are $$m$$ workers at the activity, then $$\text{capacity} = m/\text{processing time}$$.

**Bottleneck** refers the the process step with the *lowest* capacity (or highest *processing time*). **Process capacity** is the capacity of the *bottleneck*. Note that even the bottleneck can have excess capacity when there is insufficient demand. So the **flow rate** is the minimum of demand rate and process capacity. The **utilization** is $$\frac{\text{flow rate}}{\text{capacity}}$$ which is 1 if demand equals to or exceeds capacity.

## Labor Productivity
The processing time for activities in a process vary, and labor have **idle time**. We want to measure the labor productivity.

**Cycle time** is $$CT=1/\text{flow rate}$$. It measures how much time passes between the completion of two subsequent flow units. **Direct labor content** is the sum of all processing times. If one worker is staffed at each activity, the **direct idle time** is the sum of difference between *cycle time* and *processing time*.

$$\text{Average labor utilization}=\frac{\text{labor content}}{\text{labor content}+\text{direct idle time}}$$
$$\text{Cost of direct labor}=\frac{\text{total wages per unit of time}}{\text{flow rate per unit of time}}$$

While labor costs appear small at first, they are important if we roll up costs throughout the value chain (you are paying for your suppliers' labor) and they are relative to the value added.

## Little's Law
Little's Law states that **the average inventory I is equal to the average flow rate R times the average flow time T**. The implications are
1. Out of the three fundamental performance measures (I, R, T), only two can be chosen by the management.
2. If we hold throughput constant, reducing inventory is equivalent to reducing flow time.
3. Given the two of the three measures, we can solve for the third.

Note that Little's Law deals with **averages**, which can be misleading as actual values vary from the averages.

## Inventory Turns
From Little's Law, the flow rate $$R$$ is COGS (cost of goods sold). We can compute **inventory turns** as

$$\text{Inventory turns}=\frac{\text{COGS}}{\text{Inventory}}$$

Note to use COGS instead of revenue when computing inventory turns, as the margin of the company has no impact on inventory turns. Inventory turns measure how efficient the company uses its working capital.

There is a cost of capital (borrowing), storage, and obsolescence (goods decrease value over time), called **annual inventory costs**, expressed as a percentage of the inventory. We can compute the per-unit inventory cost by dividing (annualized) inventory turns into annual inventory costs. This is the cost of holding inventory.

$$\text{Per unit inventory cost}=\frac{\text{annual inventory costs}}{\text{inventory turns}}$$

In most businesses, higher inventory turns has a very significant impact on the bottom line.

## Reasons for Inventory
So inventory has a cost, why do companies hold inventory? As the flow rate is the minimum of demand and capacity, both of them can vary greatly. There is a saying called "**buffer or suffer**": if a system is not able to buffer the variability of demand or capacity, it will suffer a loss of flow rate. Inventory acting like a buffer, helps us with the flow rate by decoupling the supply and the demand.

Buffering is easier in production settings than in services. In services, there are two strategies, make to order (inventory is order) and  make to stock (inventory is services). Make-to-Stock advantages include:
* Scale economies in production
* Rapid fulfillment (short flow time for customer order) Rapid fulfillment (short flow time for customer order)

Make-to-Order advantages include:
* Fresh preparation (flow time for the sandwich)
* Allows for more customization (you can't hold a t hold all versions versions of a sandwich in stock)
* Produce exactly in the quantity demanded

We have five reasons for inventory:
1. Pipeline inventory: you will need some minimum inventory because of the flow time > 0. This is the direct reason from Little's Law.
1. Seasonal inventory: driven by seasonal variation in demand and constant capacity.
1. Cycle inventory: economies of scale in production (purchasing drinks).
1. Safety inventory: buffer against demand (McDonald's hamburgers).
1. Decoupling inventory/buffers: buffers between several internal steps.

## Multiple Flow Units
A system often deals with multiple flow units. Finding the bottleneck in such a system requires new methods.

One method is to compute
1. the capacity of each resource;
2. the demand from each flow unit at each resource;
3. the sum of demand of each resource;
4. the "implied utilization" by capacity/demand. The resource with highest implied utilization is the bottleneck.

Another method is to convert flow units into a generic flow unit of "minute of work" and compute capacity and demand accordingly.

## Process with Attrition Loss
In many processes only a percentage of items go from one activity to another, due to filtering, production defects, etc. We should compute the demand for each step in the process as it goes through and the (implied) utilization to determine the bottleneck.

# Productivity
**Productivity** is units output produced divided by input used. For example, labor productivity is number of units (output) per hour (labor time as input). Waste and inefficiency, as measured as the distance to the efficiency frontier, reduces productivity.

## Waste
1. Overproduction: to produce sooner or in greater quantities than what customers demand.
   * Overproduced items need to be stored (inventory) and create further waste;
   * Bad for inventory turns;
   * Products become obsolete / get stolen / etc.
1. Transportation: unnecessary movement of parts or people between processes.
1. Rework: repetition or correction of a process.
   - Rework is failure to meet the "do it right the first time" expectation;
   - Can be caused by methods, materials, machines, or manpower;
   - Requires additional resources so that normal production is not disrupted.
1. Over-processing: processing beyond what the customer requires.
   - May result from internal standards that do not reflect true customer requirements;
   - May be an undesirable effect of an operatorâ€™s pride in his work.
1. Motion: unnecessary movement of parts or people within a process. "Moving is not working."
1. Inventory: number of flow units in the system.
1. Waiting: underutilizing people or parts while a process completes a work cycle.
   - The flow unit waits for a resource.
   - The resource can wait for the flow unit in the form of idle time.

## KPI and KPI Tree
Productivity improvements can lead to improved finance. Big financial reward often happens in organizations with high fixed costs for even small productivity improvements. Finding out what areas in an operations will lead you to the biggest financial rewards is a key skill.

**Key Performance Indicators** (KPI) are factors that drives the profitability of the business. It creates the starting point for sensitivity analysis that would formally let us identify those operational variables that yield the biggest financial improvements. KPI trees are powerful ways to visualize the relationship between the many operational variables and the financial bottom line.

![KPI Tree]({{ "/assets/posts/coursera-operations-management/kpi-tree.png" | absolute_url }})

KPI tree starts with revenue and cost and recursively iterate through all factors in the operation that contribute to revenue or cost. The KPI tree for Subway is shown above.

## Overall Equipment Effectiveness
The **overall equipment effective framework**, or OEE framework for short, counts all the time that you have available on a resource. The resource can be people or machinery. It starts with a timeframe (e.g., a year, a month), and then identifies all these things at the resource that are waste. By taking these pieces out of the available time, you are left with the time that the resource is really productive. This is the overall equipment effectiveness. It's a fraction of time that the resource is adding value.

For example, the OEE of an aircraft is shown below.
![OEE]({{ "/assets/posts/coursera-operations-management/oee.png" | absolute_url }})

## Takt Time
One of the most obvious forms of capacity wastage is idle time, which happens due to bottleneck and lack of demand.

**Takt time** is the average time between the start of production of one unit and the start of production of the next unit, when these production starts are set to match the rate of customer demand. "Takt" is a German word which stands for the beat of the music. The **target manpower** is the round-up of division between labor content and Takt time.

Line balancing is about sharing the work equally among the resources in the process.
1. Determine Takt time.
2. Assign tasks to resource so that total processing times < Takt time.
3. Make sure that all tasks are assigned.

Then to minimize the number of people needed. Small processes can do this through try-and-error.

Capacity tends to be fixed, while demand changes often over time. This leads to temporary mismatches between supply and demand. To staff to demand:
1. Estimate your demand over time.
2. Level the demand at a coarser time unit because one cannot change staffing minute by minute.
3. Calculate the Takt time and target manpower for each time period.
4. Design a process to move effectively between different staffing.

## Quartile Analysis
In practice, the variation of processing times across workers impact the overall operational performance. The idea of quartile analysis is to compare the processing time between the top $$x$$%-tile and the bottom $$x$$%-tile. Reducing these productivity gaps between the top quarter and the bottom quarter employees provides an enormous financial opportunity. Typically, if we can transfer the best practices from the top performers to the bottom performers, the average productivity is going to be lifted upwards. This is the idea behind standardization.

## Productivity Ratios
Productivity is defined as Output units produced / Input used. Output is hard to measure. Often times we use revenue instead. There are multiple input factors, such as labor, material, capital, and we often use one category.

We can break the productivity ratio into multiple terms, each representing one aspect of the operation. For example.
![Productivity Ratios]({{ "/assets/posts/coursera-operations-management/productivity-ratios.png" | absolute_url }})

In general you can take two approaches. First, look top-down. Start from the finance, work yourself down into the operations using tools such as a productivity ratio, and compliment this with observational data from the front line. Second is bottom-up. Look at the operational data and aggregate them using the tools, such as the KPI tree, to look how they are driving financial performance. This is where you get a balanced view of your productivity in the operation.

# Quality
