This is fourth of the note series I took when studying for [Financial Markets](https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-markets-global/home/welcome) by Prof. Robert Shiller, offered by Coursera. This covers the content for Week 4.

This module takes a look into the recent past, explores recessions, bubbles, the mortgage crisis, and regulation.

# Recessions
Recessions are substantially psychological, thus it is difficult for anybody, a central bank, central government to deal with them.

Inverted yield curve is a situation in which short term interest rates, like overnight rates or three-month rates, are above long-term interest rates. That's not the usual situation because long term, obviously long term bonds are riskier because the payout is coming much later. So people generally demand a higher, and the market will give them a higher interest rate, but sometimes it's inverted. It's been shown statistically that that's a leading indicator of a recession.

## Excessive Reserves after the Financial Crisis
Government regulators impose reserve requires that banks have to keep a certain amount of cash on reserve to meet any sudden increase in withdrawals (bank runs). For most of the time in recent history, banks don't keep excessive reserve beyond what is required by regulators. However, during or after the financial crisis, we see large amount of excessive reserves held by banks.

The reasons are follows:
1. The interest rate is effectively 0%, thus reserve holding does not lose to risk-free investment opportunities.
2. Risky investment opportunities are subject to adverse selection and moral hazard problems. Lending during this period of time will only attract borrower with worse financial situations.

# Mortgage and Real Estate

## Commercial Real Estate Vehicles
### Real Estate Partnership
Real Estate Partnership is a major example of Direct Participation Program, a class of investments that also includes oil and gas explorations and equipment leasing program. Real Estate Limited Partnership provides limited liability to partners.

Direct Participation Program are "flow-through vehicles", as profits become investors' income, thus it escapes corporate income tax. On the other hand, program losses can be claimed as deductions by investors.

IRS requires that DPP cannot be perpetual. Unlike corporations, it must have a finite life.

In order to buy in a real estate partnership, you need to be an "accredited investor", which is a term defined by Security and Exchange Commission in terms of wealth and income.

There are two types of partners in the Limited Partnership structure:
* General Partner: runs the business, must own at least 1%, and does not have limited liability. General partners or their associates runs the offering to sell units to investors.
* Limited Partner: passive investors with limited liability, rights to vote, and rights to replace general partner. They give general partner performance-based compensation.

### REITs
Real Estate Investment Trust were created by US Congress in 1960s to allow small investors to access the real estate investment.

Before 1960, companies that own real estate were considered businesses, and thus subject to corporate income tax. So (to avoid corporate income tax,) until 1960, real estate are largely owned by partnerships, not suitable for small investors.

Now REITs become big and institutions invest in REITs too.

There are restrictions on REITs regarding their assets, income, and income payouts.

## Mortgage
The word "mortgage" comes from Latin, and it means "dead pledge". It came to English via French. Verb mortgage means committing property as a collateral for a loan.

Mortgage was difficult when property laws were not well-developed.

Mortgage market in the U.S. is big, with over 40 million mortgaged homes. Before 1930, mortgage was in a form of five-year or less loans that can be renewed or refinanced after two years. During the Great Depression this became an issue as the house was under water (i.e. outstanding loan amount is greater than the value of the house) and people were out of job. in 1934 the Federal Housing Administration was established to insure the lender from the default risk (basically the government betted on its own people). It also requires mortgages to be longer than 15 years.

The interest rate of 30-year mortgage correlates closely to the YTM of 10-year treasury bond. The reason of this correlation is because most of mortgages don't last for 30 years. They last for about 10 years. There is a spread between the two because 1) mortgages tend to be more risky than treasury even mortgages can be insured; 2) and mortgages need to be serviced.

The type of mortgages:
* conventional, fixed-rate mortgage (amortizing, long term);
* Adjustable rate mortgage;
* Price level adjusted mortgage (PLAM): payment is adjusted to inflation so it is constant in real term. This was popular when inflation and interest rate were high, like in the 1980s. PLAM may have negative amortization, meaning the payment for any period is less than the interest rate charged over the period, so that the outstanding balance of the loan increases. This is possible if the inflation rate is higher than the growth of principal (due to negative amortization), thus the real value of the mortgage still decreases.
* Dual rate mortgage (DRM) same as PLAM but interest rate floats;
* Shared appreciation mortgage, in which you pay out some of the appreciation of the house in lieu of the mortgage. It was popular in the UK before the financial crisis.
* First mortgages;
* Home equity loans, a loan based on the value of the house that you can take on later to get cash from your home.

Related terms to mortgages:
* Amortization: refers to spreading payments over multiple periods. In lending, amortization is the distribution of loan repayments into multiple cash flow installments, as determined by an amortization schedule. Each repayment installment consists of both principal and interest. Payments are divided into equal amounts for the duration of the loan, making it the simplest repayment model. A greater amount of the payment is applied to interest at the beginning of the amortization schedule, while more money is applied to principal at the end. Commonly it is known as EMI or Equated Monthly Installment.
* Balloon payment: a large payment due at the end of a balloon loan. A balloon loan typically features a relatively short term, and only a portion of the loan's principal balance is amortized over the term. At the end of the term, the remaining balance is due as a final repayment.

### Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)
The insurance that insures mortgages and is paid by the borrower (i.e. homeowner). Both Fannie and Freddie require mortgagors buy mortgage insurance if the down payment is less than 20%.

It draws controversy when home value increases, the mortgage balance becomes less than 80% of the home value, thus PMI is no longer needed, but mortgage lenders do not notify borrowers to cancel PMI.

## Mortgage Derivatives
### Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMO)
Because mortgage has value, it can be sold to others. CMO is a pool of mortgages, sold as securities to investors, and thus the lender becomes only the servicer of the mortgages.

CMOs are divided into trenches in terms of prepayment risk, with most senior trench gets the highest payment priority over all other trenches if the mortgage defaults. In this way, CMOs can earn higher ratings than the underlying mortgages or directly-securitized mortgages.

Sequential-Pay CMOs: the first trench gets principal payments first; after it is paid off, the second trench gets principal payments.

### Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDO)
Like a more generalized CMO, CDO holds securities, typically mortgage securities as its assets. CDOs divide the cash flow into a number of tranches in terms of *default risk*.

CDOs got into trouble during the financial crisis. It drew criticisms of rating agencies for not downgrading them (or giving them too high a rating), and its value dropped too much when the market panicked.

The problem withe CMOs and CDOs is that the mortgage originator does not care whether the mortgage it approves would default or not, and it makes more money by issuing more mortgages. Thus it is in mortgage originator's interest to approve mortgages for anybody, including those who cannot show evidence of a good record (i.e. the mortgage is called "liar's loan"). To address this problem, the European parliament requires mortgage originator must hold at least 5% of the mortgages it issues. The Dodd-Frank Act copies this idea, but provides exemption to Qualifying Residential Mortgages (QRMs), whose definition was established in 2014 (4 years later) in a complicated way.

# The Real Estate Bubble
Home price has been stable (inflation adjusted) for the past 100 years, except since 2000 when home price increased significantly, and crashed during the financial crisis.

Due to technology advancement, the building cost of homes has been falling for the last half century. If you go outside major cities, the cost of land is rather a small component of home prices, and the structure cost depreciates quite fast because of wear and going out of fashion.

Thus, in late 1990s to early 2000s, the home price is seen as always going up, resulting in a bubble.

There are evidences of feedback mechanism between expected return of real estate and home prices: when home prices go up, so does the expected return. There are correlations between home prices and number of housing units started: when home prices go up, so does start of new constructions, because constructors want to maximize their profit. Therefore, the cause and burst of the bubble has something to do with human nature.

In addition, people tend to think that house appreciation is high relative to mortgage interest rate, when home prices have been on the rise. For example, people think house will appreciate at 12% annually for the next 10 years while mortgage interest rate is at 6%, and home prices are at all time high. The spread was reduced to almost 0 when home prices collapsed.

The financial crisis is usually dated in 2007, but there were signs of bubble in the housing market in 2005 when media was discussing a home-buying mania in the American public.

The word "bubble" was first used in financial market in a stock market crash in the 1700s in France, and was widely used in academia since the financial crisis. However, bubble implies that it would pop completely at certain stage, but the market will not completely crash. It would be more appropriate to use "epidemic" as it comes and goes as well as being contagious.

# Financial Regulation
Regulation is substantially aimed at dealing with human problems, manipulation and deception, as well as making the system work better by addressing problems such as monopoly and externalities, e.g. "too big to fail".

Most regulation just prior to the financial crisis emphasized at microprudential, meaning it aimed to protect individuals from abuse. On the contrary, macroprudential is regulation to help prevent big crisis in the macro economy.

Business wants regulation, because without regulation, people are forced to do things in a competitive system that they think are bad for the society. Businesses are forced to the lowest common denominator which can be ugly. A good analogy is sport referee.

Five levels of financial regulation:
1. Within-firm regulation;
2. Trade groups;
3. Local government regulation;
4. National government regulation;
5. International regulation.

## Within-Firm Regulation
The Board of Directors acts like a regulator. Often companies have outside directors represent a broader community. Thus board of directors cannot be a full-time job. Usually companies have board of directors who have good reputations, so that they can prevent devious tricks from happening within the company.

One devious trick within a company is tunneling, expropriation by minority shareholders (figuratively, as by an underground tunnel). Tunneling is more common in civil law countries (where laws are made by parliament or congress) than in common law countries (where laws are made by congress but legal precedence set by courts act as law as well). Hence, the proportion of private and family-owned companies is higher in civil law countries. Tunneling is achieved by:

* Asset sales below market value;
* Contracts with higher cost for service;
* Excessive executive compensation;
* Loan guarantees for other corporations;
* Expropriation of corporate opportunities to outsiders;
* Dilutive share issues;
* Insider trading.

U.S. law enforces duty on board of directors to prevent tunneling. The law specifies the Duty of Care (act as a reasonable, prudent or rational person would), and Duty of Loyalty (prevent insiders from benefiting at the expense of shareholders). Common law countries give more judicial discretion to judge conformance with these duties, and so are more effective in preventing self-dealing transactions.

## Trade Groups
One example of trade groups is stock exchange. The first stock exchange in the U.S. agreed on fixed commission, and requires subscribers only to trade with other subscribers. The fixed commission is abolished in 1975.

## Local Regulation
U.S. started as a confederate of states, so state government is often referred as "local government".

Banking regulation belonged to the states until the National Banking Act of 1863. Stock regulation moved to the federal government when the SEC was founded. But corporate regulation is still at the local government level.

Blue sky laws, referring to regulations on the offering and sale of securities to protect the public from fraud, was enacted in Kansas in 1911, and was widely adopted by other states shortly after. It regulates brokers and advisers.

## National Regulation
National regulation started with SEC as part of Roosevelt's New Deal in 1934 to address the failure of local regulation. It was initially viewed by businesses as a radical, almost, socialist, institution. It is peculiar that it started in the U.S>, and imitated by other countries.

SEC Rules require every broker, stock exchange, and every security must register with SEC, but registration does not literally mean SEC approval.

### Public vs. Private Securities
One major effort by the SEC is to define public vs. private securities. Public securities need to undergo approved process of issuance under SEC surveillance. Public companies must file quarterly public states. The EDGAR database holds filings of all public companies.

The Initial Public Offering (IPO) is an SEC procedure for going public.

### Hedge Funds
It is for wealthy investors only, and is under SEC regulation.

Those structured as 3c1s (refers to some lines in the SEC regulation) can take no more than 99 investors, and they must be "accredited investors" as defined by the SEC (which means income of $200000 or investable assets of $1 million). Those structured as 3c7s can take 500 investors, but they must be "qualified purchasers" as defined by the SEC (which means individuals with net worth of at least $5 million or institutions with net worth of at least $25 million).

### Insiders vs. Outsiders
Insiders are people with special access to information about a company. Inside information represents wealth, and SEC tries to define access to this wealth, by disclosure rules. Regulation FD (Full Disclosure) requires that when a company tells any material fact to an analyst, it must immediately tell the public.

Brokers and stock exchanges have built sophisticated system to detect insider trading.

### Accounting Standards
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) was officially recognized as the authoritative by SEC in 1973. Though it has the statutory right to make accounting standards, it prefers private sector to do it. FASB defines the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), used for EDGAR.

### Brokerage Firms
A brokerage firm, or brokerage, is a financial institution that facilitates the buying and selling of financial securities between a buyer and a seller. It serves a clientele of investors who trade public stocks and other securities, usually through the firm's agent stockbrokers (which trades on the exchange floor). The brokerage usually holds the stock on behalf of the clients, and the shares are usually held in what's called "street name", unless the brokerage reports the names of stock holders to the company. Thus, when a brokerage firm fails, investors are at risk losing their holdings.

Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) was created by U.S. Congress in 1970 to protect customers of brokerage firms or clearing houses from failure, up to $500,000 per account, $100,000 for cash.

## International Regulation
Bank for International Settlements were created in 1930 by Hague Agreements. It is like a bank of banks, has 57 member central banks, who are national regulators. It is located in Basel, Switzerland. Basel Committee was created by the G10 in 1974 to coordinate banking regulation, and was renewed multiple times.

Financial Stability Board was created by G20 from the former Financial Stability Forum (founded by G7). It makes recommendations to the G20, which may end up adopted in many countries. It is located in Basel, Switzerland, too.

World economy dominates more and more, and so regulation will shift to international.
