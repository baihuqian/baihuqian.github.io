This is a new series of learning I took on to enhance my knowledge about distributed system. This series will focus on reading papers selected by [a University of Chicago reading course](http://uchicago-cs.github.io/cmsc23310/calendar.html).

Week 2 focuses on distributed time.

## [Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2016/12/Time-Clocks-and-the-Ordering-of-Events-in-a-Distributed-System.pdf)
