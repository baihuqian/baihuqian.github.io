Depth First Traversal (or Search) for a graph is similar to Depth First Traversal of a tree. The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles, so we may come to the same node again. To avoid processing a node more than once, we use a boolean visited array.

For example, in the following graph, we start traversal from vertex 2. When we come to vertex 0, we look for all adjacent vertices of it. 2 is also an adjacent vertex of 0. If we donâ€™t mark visited vertices, then 2 will be processed again and it will become a non-terminating process. A Depth First Traversal of the following graph is 2, 0, 1, 3.

# Implementation
```python
# Python program to print DFS traversal from a
# given given graph
from collections import defaultdict

# This class represents a directed graph using adjacency list representation. Vertices are from 0 to n - 1
class Graph:

    # Constructor
    def __init__(self):
        # default dictionary to store graph
        self.graph = defaultdict(list)

    # function to add an edge to graph
    def addEdge(self, u, v):
        self.graph[u].append(v)

    # A function used by DFS
    def DFSUtil(self, v, visited):

        # Mark the current node as visited and print it
        visited[v]= True
        print v,

        # Recur for all the vertices adjacent to this vertex
        for i in self.graph[v]:
            if visited[i] == False:
                self.DFSUtil(i, visited)


    # The function to do DFS traversal. It uses
    # recursive DFSUtil()
    def DFS(self, v):

        # Mark all the vertices as not visited
        visited = [False] * len(self.graph)

        # Call the recursive helper function to print
        # DFS traversal
        self.DFSUtil(v, visited)
```

# Kosaraju's Two-Pass Algorithm for Strongly-Connected Components
1. Run DFS on the graph with all edges reversed.
2. Run DFS on the original graph.
