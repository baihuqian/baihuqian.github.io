# Question
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

Example 1:
```
Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
```

# DP Solution
Track whether a position could reach the last index.

```python
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if len(nums) <= 1:
            return True

        dp = [False for _ in range(len(nums))]
        dp[-1] = True

        for i in range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1):
            k = nums[i]
            for step in range(1, k + 1):
                if i + step < len(nums) and dp[i + step] == True:
                    dp[i] = True
                    break

        return dp[0]

```

# Greedy
Track the leftmost index that can reach the last index.

```python
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        length = len(nums)
        if length <= 1:
            return True

        good_pos = length - 1

        for i in range(length - 2, -1, -1):
            if nums[i] + i >= good_pos:
                good_pos = i

        return good_pos == 0
```
