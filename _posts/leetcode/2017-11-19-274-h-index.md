# Question

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index *h* if *h* of his/her *N* papers have **at least** *h* citations each, and the other *N âˆ’ h* papers have no more than *h* citations each."

For example, given `citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5]`, which means the researcher has `5` papers in total and each of them had received `3, 0, 6, 1, 5` citations respectively. Since the researcher has `3` papers with **at least** `3` citations each and the remaining two with **no more** than `3` citations each, his h-index is `3`.

Note: If there are several possible values for `h`, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

# Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def hIndex(self, citations):
        """
        :type citations: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        N = len(citations)
        if (N == 0):
            return 0
        if (N == 1):
            return min(1, citations[0])

        citations.sort(reverse=True)

        for h in range(1, N):
            if(citations[h-1] >= h and citations[h] <= h):
                return h
        if(citations[N-1] >= N):
            return N
        else:
            return 0

```
