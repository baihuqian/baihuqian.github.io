# Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        int[] charMap = new int[26];
        Arrays.fill(charMap, 0);

        for(char c: s.toCharArray()) {
            charMap[c - 'a']++;
        }

        for(char c: t.toCharArray()) {
            if(--charMap[c - 'a'] < 0)
                return c;
        }

        return 0;
    }
}
