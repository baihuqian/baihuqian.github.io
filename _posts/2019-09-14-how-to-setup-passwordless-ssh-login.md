Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure connection between a client and a server and supports various authentication mechanisms. The two most popular mechanisms are passwords based authentication and public key based authentication.

To set up a passwordless SSH login in Linux all you need to do is to generate a public authentication key and append it to the remote hosts `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

# Generate an SSH Keypair
Before generating a new SSH keypair, you should check if there is an existing one. You may already have an SSH key to use with Git repo such as GitHub.

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh/*.pub
```
If you see `No such file or directory` or `no matches found` it means that you do not have an SSH key and you can proceed with the next step and generate a new one.

The following command will generate a new 4096 bits SSH key pair with your email address as a comment:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@domain.com"
```

Press Enter to accept the default file location and file name:

```bash
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/yourusername/.ssh/id_rsa):
```

Next, the `ssh-keygen` tool will ask you to type a secure passphrase. In most cases, developers and system administrators use SSH without a passphrase because they are useful for fully automated processes. If you choose to use passphrase you will get an extra layer of security. If you donâ€™t want to use passphrase just press `Enter`

```bash
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
```

To be sure that the SSH keys are generated you can list your new private and public keys with:

```bash
ls ~/.ssh/id_*
/home/yourusername/.ssh/id_rsa /home/yourusername/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

# Copy the Public Key to Remote Host

The easiest way to copy your public key to your server is to use a command called `ssh-copy-id`. On your local machine terminal type:

```bash
ssh-copy-id remote_username@server_ip_address
```

You will be prompted to enter the remote_username password. Once the user is authenticated, the public key will be appended to the remote user `authorized_keys` file and connection will be closed.

If by some reason the `ssh-copy-id` utility is not available on your local computer you can use the following command to copy the public key:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh remote_username@server_ip_address "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

# Verify
After completing the steps above you should be able log in to the remote server without being prompted for a password.

To test it just try to login to your server via SSH:
```bash
ssh remote_username@server_ip_address
```

If everything went well, you will be logged in immediately.
