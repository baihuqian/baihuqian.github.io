# Go Workspace
Go is designed to work when your code is inside a workspace. The workspace is a folder composed of `bin`, `pkg` and `src` subfolders. In short, create a `go` folder with a `src` subfolder wherever you expect to put your projects. The workspace defined by `$GOPATH`. Simply set `export GOPATH=~/gocode` to set the workspace root at `~/gocode`.

# Compile
Go is a compiled language. It is compiled to assembly language. `go build` compiles the code, but throws away the output. To make your package accessible to the workspace, you need to use `go install` to generate a package file in `pkg/` folder under the workspace.

`go install` compiles source code within a `src` folder and generate an executable in `$GOPATH/bin/` folder.

`go run` is a handy command that compiles and runs your code.

# Run
In Go, the entry point to a program has to be a function called `main` within a package `main`.

## Unit test
Go's unit test lives in the package directory and ends in `_test.go`. Tests will be part of the source package, but it won't be built into the package. When we run `go test`, Go compiles everything in the package and synthesize all test functions that begins with `Test`.
