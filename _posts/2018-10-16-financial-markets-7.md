This is sixth of the note series I took when studying for [Financial Markets](https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-markets-global/home/welcome) by Prof. Robert Shiller, offered by Coursera. This covers the content for Week 6.

This module includes lectures about nonprofits and corporations, and your career in finance.

# Nonprofits
The defining character of nonprofits is the non-distribution constraint. Profits are not distributed as dividends because there are no owners or shareholders. Nonprofits are tax exempt.

However, nonprofits give bonuses just as for-profits, because they have to compete with for-profits. 42% of all nonprofits have a formal executive bonus system in place (2007-2008), and the percent is increasing.

Board of trustees appoints own successors.

It may not be much different to you compared to setting up a for-profit, but it gives you benefit such as moral high ground, tax savings, etc.

# Cooperatives
Cooperatives are not non-profit in the sense that they may distribute profits. But it is not the same as corporation. The voting system for cooperatives is one person one vote.

# Benefit Corporation
This is a new corporate form, first created in Maryland in 2010. Note that securities law is at the federal level, but corporate law is still at the state level, so states must adopt them in state legislation.

A benefit corporation is halfway between for-profit and non-profit. Its company charter must state a social or environmental purpose, and is required to pursue that as well as profit.
