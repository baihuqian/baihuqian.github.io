This is sixth of the note series I took when studying for [Financial Markets](https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-markets-global/home/welcome) by Prof. Robert Shiller, offered by Coursera. This covers the content for Week 6.

This module covers investment banking, underwriting processes, brokers, dealers, exchanges, and new innovations in financial markets.

# Investment Banks
Investment banks are different from commercial banks:
* Investment banks do not accept deposits, and have not been regulated as banks.
* Investment banks traditionally are not members of the Federal Reserve System, and do not normally access discount window (an instrument of monetary policy, usually controlled by central banks, that allows eligible institutions to borrow money from the central bank, usually on a short-term basis, to meet temporary shortages of liquidity caused by internal or external disruptions).
* Investment banks underwrites securities instead of making loans.

Traditional US bulge-bracket (a slang term to describe the largest and most profitable multi-national investment banks) firms have been merged with other banks (such as First Boston with Credit Suisse, Salomon Brothers with Citicorp, or Merrill Lynch with Bank of America), become a bank holding company after the Financial Crisis (regulated as a bank, such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley), or bankrupted (Lehman Brothers).

## Underwriting
Underwriting of securities is the issuance of shares and corporate debt. Investment bank is sort of like a consulting firm that provides advice on financing. Underwriter provides advice to the issuer, distribution of securities, sharing of risks of issue, and stabilization of aftermarket.

Underwriter also "certifies" the issue by putting its reputation behind the issue, which address the moral hazard problem that firms have incentive to issue shares when they know their earnings are only temporarily high. Investment banks do their best to price the new issuance correctly. Market share loss occurs to investment banks that repeatedly underprice or underprice issues.

Two kinds of offerings:
* Bought deal (synonym: Firm commitment offering): the underwriter agrees to buy all shares that are not sold.
* Best efforts: the underwriter says that if the issue is not sold, deal collapses.

The underwriting process is defined by regulation and tradition.
1. Prefiling period. The investment bank advises issuers about their choices, forms an agreement among underwriters, designates managers and agrees on fees. It also files registration statement with the SEC. A single investment bank may not be able to handle a big issue, so several investment banks form a syndicate to issue shares together.
2. Cooling-off period. The preliminary prospectus (red herring) is distributed.
3. Investment banks call prospective clients for indication of interest, perform due diligence of the issuer, and decide on offering price.
4. The underwriting syndicate agrees on how to split the offering, and produces the underwriting agreement.
5. Produce dealer agreement. Dealers purchase from underwriter at a discount from public price.
6. Decide on the effective date.
7. Investment banks support the price in the aftermarket, called "stabilization". It is a form of market manipulation by the underwriter near the time of the issue that is permitted by the SEC. During stabilization, the underwriting syndicate is legally allowed to conspire to "fix" prices in market until the entire issue is sold out.

## Initial Public Offering
An initial public offering is an offering of a shares in a company for the first time publicly. Prices tend to jump up immediately after an IPO is issued, so apparently there is money left upon the table. But it is a common practice in IPO to ensure shares can be sold quickly and prices would not drop shortly after IPO.

The long-run performance of IPOs tend to be poor. Although average IPOs earn +16% return on the first day, this return tends to be offset over the next three years (Jay Ritter).

The reason behind underpricing in IPO: Impressario Hypothesis (analogy to sellers of tickets to concerts). Underpricing creates higher demand, more interest, and attract the right people (e.g. in concerts you want young people, and in IPO you want mature, long-term investors over flippers).

## Rating Agencies
Instead of trusting investment banks on worthiness of companies, one could get the information from a rating agency. Rating Agencies are barriers to adverse selection. John L. Moody founded the first rating agency in 1909. Moody's started using letter grades, and AAA is the best rating.

Agencies would not accept money from the people they rated, but that broke down in 1970s when they found it difficult to keep up with the complexities of the securities.

Part of the financial crisis is the agency problem, as the rating agencies gave AAA to CDOs holding subprime mortgages. They are since under tighter regulations.

## Regulation Effort
The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 after the Great Depression, created the modern concept of "investment bank". It separated commercial banks, investment banks, and insurance companies. It also created the FDIC.

In the 1990s the Glass-Steagall Act was relaxed and rescinded, which resulted in a wave of mergers among commercial banks, investment banks, and insurance companies.

Volcker Rule was incorporated into the Dodd-Frank Act that commercial banks are no longer allowed to own hedge funds or do proprietary trading.

# Professional Money Managers
Money managers are professionals who invests other people's money in stocks and bonds or other normal investable assets in the open market by taking over the management of their portfolio.

## Prudent Man
Regulation requires money managers to act like a "prudent man". The Employment Retirees Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) defines the prudent man rule, which requires fiduciaries to act:

>With the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.

Basically a prudent man would do what somebody else would do in this circumstance.

Dodd-Frank Act moved away from the prudent person rule, but use a prudential standard. The new idea is not to rely on fiduciaries to use their own judgment as to what is prudent, but to impose regulatory standards.

## Financial Advisors
Financial Advisors are anyone who advises others on the value of securities or advisability of investing, or who publishes analysis. It excludes bankers, lawyers, reporters, professors, and excludes Broker Dealers whose advice is only incidental to their business.

The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 (NSMIA) requires all advisors managing more than $30 million to register with SEC. Those managing less than $25 million must register with state securities regulator. The Act does not mention “prudent person” but does bar convicted felons from serving as an adviser.

## Financial Planners
Financial Planners perform comprehensive planning for life, rather than just picking stocks. They are not regulated, not licensed in most countries. But in the U.S., financial planners must be registered as a financial advisor first.

They are mostly regulated by associations. For example, in US, there isFinancial Planning Association.

Certified Financial Planner (CFP) designation is awarded by Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc.

## Mutual Fund and ETF
First mutual fund appeared in Holland in 1770s.

In 1920s, many investment companies existed to serve the public, but the classes of shares were set up to trick small investors. At that time, Massachusetts Investment Trust had only one class of investors, published portfolio, and could be redeemed on demand. It quickly became the model for mutual fund industry.

The definition of a mutual fund is specified by the SEC under regulation. Mutual fund cannot be bought at an exchange; it must be bought from the investment company or through "supermarket". The transaction happens at 4 pm after the market close.

An open-ended fund, meaning the creation and redemption is done through the fund company. A close-ended fund, meaning, once created (like an IPO), it circulates on the exchange and cannot be directly redeemed at the fund company. While close-ended fund can be traded during trading hours, its value can diverge from its net-asset value (NAV).

The Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) appeared much later in 1993 with the introduction of Standard & Poor Deposit Receipt (SPDR, spiders), which invests in S&P 500 index. It is traded in exchanges. Compared to mutual fund, its management fee is low. ETF addresses the divergence of NAV of the underlying portfolio by introducing authorized participants, a group of financial firms that can automatically create and redeem units in large amount, so that any premium or discount between the ETF and its NAV can be arbitraged away.

# Brokers and Dealers
Brokers act on behalf of others as their agent for which they earn a commission.

Dealers always act for themselves, in other words, they act as principals in the transaction (seller or buyer) for which they make a markup. Dealers stand to buy and sell at posted prices, bid and asked, in order to profit from the bid-ask spread rather than commission.

A firm doing business as a broker or dealer must register with SEC as Broker-Dealer. A person can never be a broker and a dealer in the same transaction. In other words, never make both a commission and a trade on the same trade.

There are rarely any real estate dealers in the U.S., because dealers pay ordinary income tax on capital gains, and real estate is usually held for a much longer period in between to qualify for long-term capital gain if the owner is not a dealer.

Good dealers do not churn (encourage clients to buy and sell frequently), and SEC penalizes "rogue brokers" who churn.

# Exchanges
The traditional four markets are:

1. First stock exchange in the US is NYSE (1792).
2. Second market is NASDAQ which is computerized to replace "pink sheets".
3. NASDAQ small cap.
4. Large institutions trade amongst themselves without the use of a securities firm.

Exchanges provide standards and codes of ethics for broker members, standards for stocks, and they must be registered and regulated by the SEC.

There are markets to lend (not sell) stocks for short sellers.

Listings matter in the sense that people tend to trader locally-listed stocks, and stocks co-move with co-listed stocks. It is a familiarity bias.

## Limit Order Book
A book with all outstanding bid (buy) and ask (sell) orders, consist of number of shares and price per share, ordered by price. Computerized exchange made it possible for people to access them.

## Payment for Order Flow
Brokers receive order from customers. But in order to fulfill them, brokers transfer orders to a stock exchange, who executes the order to find a counter party for the trade.

However, there is someone who is willing to pay brokers to get the orders, and such payment is called payment for order flow. Thus, brokers "sell" the order flow to "crossing networks" who profit from the order flow. However, the orders may not be executed at the best price. But SEC does not forbid it, but only requires brokers to disclose it.

## Kinds of Orders
* Market order
* Limit order
* Stop loss order

Market orders can be dangerous for thinly-traded stocks. ECN may not allow market orders.

A limit order sells at any price at or above the price given. But a stop loss order sells at any price at or below the price given.

# Public Finance
Public finance is the finance of the government. The government is just another organization that confronts markets and lenders like others and it always has been so going back into the history.

## Government Debt
Default is the failure to pay. It is different from repudiation, when a government announces that the debt is never going to be paid. There is another concept called odious debt, when a new government announces that the debt from the past government is due to corruption so it is moral not to pay it. Because repudiation damages the country's credibility for future investment, more often is that governments inflate the currency so that the real value of government debt drops.

When a country defaults on its sovereign debt, usually it is solved by negotiation between creditors and the government. To prevent a hold-up problem that a government does not pay and negotiate, there's been a movement in sovereign debt towards adding what they call collective action clauses, a contract signed by investors in sovereign bonds to agree to anything that's voted by a super-majority of the other investors in the same bond.

## Government's Involvement in Corporations
Governments all around the world regulate business. Some governments will own shares in private businesses. Private businesses know they may be nationalized in the future.

One major reason behind corporate profit tax is the recognizing of limited liability. A corporation can create more loss to a society than its share value, and thus government must cover the loss in order to honor limited liability. One example is the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) in the Fukushima disaster. The Japanese government covered the damage caused by the reactors, and owned a major stake (i.e. nationalized) in TEPCO.

Bankruptcy laws make government a shareholder in all businesses. Government may pay the damages for bankrupted companies. Chapter 7 in bankruptcy laws is for liquidation, and Chapter 11 is for reorganization.

With introduction of personal bankruptcy, every individual is like an enterprise with lenders as shareholders. The government acts as a partial shareholder because it allows individuals to take risks then declare bankruptcy if it goes badly.

## Municipal Finance
Because states in the U.S. are sovereign, there is no state bankruptcy law made by the federal government. But there are laws about bankruptcies of municipal government at the federal level.

The basic motivation behind financing with local debt besides local tax is the change in population. Sometimes there is a reasonable prospect of future population inflow. With steady population growth, cities should borrow to finance the construction to get ready for them, and the debt can be repaid by additional local tax from new population.

States have constitutional prohibitions against deficit spending on the current account. They generally adopt state income tax. States can still run deficit on capital account, so there are still state bond.

Revenue bonds: similar to equity, local government can issue revenue bonds that tie to revenue of the financed project (such as toll road). But it is only allowed when cities are doing a project that yields them improvements.

Chapter 9 defines bankruptcy for municipals.

## Government Social Insurance
Insurance is a private business, but government is involved in it. Social (government) insurance originates in Germany. Sickness insurance is instituted in 1883, accident insurance in 1884, old-age insurance in 1889. Unemployment originates in UK in 1911.

* Progressive taxes: low tax when your income drops;
* Free public education and services;
* Social security;
* Health insurance: medicare, medicaid. US is the only major developed country without a comprehensive health insurance.
* Workers compensation (US before 1920): insurance to protect employees against accidents in the workspace.

Income tax was not effective in the US until 1913 because it was difficult for the government to measure people's income due to corruption and incapacity of officers. Withholding of income tax is another important invention of income tax system to address lack of saving issues at tax time.

Survivors Insurance is government-sponsored life insurance.
