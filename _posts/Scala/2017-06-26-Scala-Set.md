Set is a collection of distinct elements. By default sets are implemented as *hash sets* with `hashCode` method. It's faster to find elements this way.

`LinkedHashSet` remembers the order in which elements are inserted with a linked list.

`SortedSet` can be iterated in sorted order. It is implemented as a red-black tree.

`BitSet` is an implementation of a set of nonnegative integers as a sequence of bits. The ith bit is 1 if i is present in the set. It's efficient as long as the maximum number os not too large.

* `contains` method checks whether a set contains a given value. `subsetOf` checks whether a set is a subset of another set.
* `union`: can be written as `|` and `++`.
* `intersect`: can be written as `&`.
* `diff`: can be written as `&~` or `--`.
